# Car-Crash-Detector
 Car Crash Detector based on CNN + HRNN (Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network) architecture to detect and predict Accidents from dash cam video feed
# Approach
The problem is solved in two parts. First is object detection and second is creating a model to detect and hence predict accidents from video feed.
# Object Detection
Object Detection is done using retinanet.
